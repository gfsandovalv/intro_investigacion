\chapter*{Abstract}

The aim of the present is to illustrate the quantum passage to classical regime using various procedures, namely Ehrenfest theorem, quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Wigner representation. Characterization of those is proposed, mainly by comparing the evolution of averages and deviations with those of classical ensembles representing the systems. The equations of motion are obtained analytically, but are expected to be solved numerically. For achieving this, various physical systems are presented, including that treated in the articles.

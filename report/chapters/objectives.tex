\chapter{Objectives}

\subsection{General}

To illustrate the quantum passage to classical regime using various procedures and characterize them quantitively, mainly by comparing the evolution of averages and deviations. The procedures to be studied are corrections to the Ehrenfest, quantum Hamilton-Jacobi and Wigner representation.

\section{Specific}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the procedures for the system presented in the articles to get the equations of motion for each description, including classical one. 
    \item Repeat the process for more general potentials
    \item Solve numerically the equations of motion for each system
    \item Compare the evolution of mean values, and deviations with those of classical ensembles for the systems
\end{enumerate}
